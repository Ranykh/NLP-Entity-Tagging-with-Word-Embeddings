# NLP Entity Tagging with Word Embeddings

This project focuses on **Named Entity Recognition (NER) and binary word classification** using **word embeddings** such as Word2Vec. The goal is to process, tag, and classify words in text using pre-trained word embeddings and machine learning models.

## Features
- Preprocessing sentences for NLP tasks.
- Extracting word embeddings using **Gensim**.
- Binary classification of words (Entity vs. Non-Entity).
- Sentence embedding construction for feature representation.
- Utilizing **Torch, NumPy, and Scikit-learn**.
